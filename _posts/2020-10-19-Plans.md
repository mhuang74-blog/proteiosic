To make me accountable, here are my plans for this blog for 2021.

Lets start with one entry in each of the following areas:

* Microcontroller. Preferrably related to TinyML.
* Donkeycar. Preferrably using above microcontroller to navigate.
* Web Analytics. Provide Google Analytics setup/analysis for non-profits.
* Machine Learning. Anomaly detection areas.
